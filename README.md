## 🎮 Number Guessing Game

The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple and interactive Java console application where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

This project demonstrates core Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, random number generation, and user input handling — making it a great beginner-level logic-based program.

### 🕹️ How the Game Works

- The computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**
- The user gets **5 attempts** to guess the correct number
- After each guess, the program provides feedback:
  - `"Too high!"`
  - `"Too low!"`
  - `"Congratulations! You guessed it!"`
- If the user guesses correctly or runs out of attempts, the round ends
- The player can choose whether to **play again or exit**

### 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | Used in Project |
|--------|------------------|
| `Scanner` | To take user input |
| `Random` class | To generate random numbers |
| Loops (`while`) | For repeated gameplay |
| Conditionals (`if-else`) | To compare guesses and give feedback |
| Boolean logic | To control replay and game flow |
